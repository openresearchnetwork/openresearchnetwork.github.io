# Partnership

Our Partnership initiative is not only about fostering collaborative
relationships and inviting companies to offer services that benefit our
affiliates but also about identifying opportunities that are mutually
beneficial. This strategy ensures that both ORN and its partners can thrive
together, sharing resources and expertise to further the cause of open and
accessible research. By joining forces, we aim to create a symbiotic ecosystem
that accelerates innovation and enhances the research landscape for all
involved.
