    ORN emerges from the vibrant Open Science Labs community, a
    collective endeavor of scientists, researchers, educators, software
    engineers, and students. Our goal is to foster connectivity among
    scientific groups across disciplines, facilitating the sharing of
    infrastructure and resources, and promoting collaborative research. By
    leveraging advanced AI and Data Science, ORN accelerates research
    efforts, both academic and private, offering tools, platforms, and
    guidance to enhance research workflows.
