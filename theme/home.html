        <p>
          ORN emerges from the vibrant Open Science Labs community, a
          collective endeavor of scientists, researchers, educators, software
          engineers, and students. Our goal is to foster connectivity among
          scientific groups across disciplines, facilitating the sharing of
          infrastructure and resources, and promoting collaborative research. By
          leveraging advanced AI and Data Science, ORN accelerates research
          efforts, both academic and private, offering tools, platforms, and
          guidance to enhance research workflows.

        <p>
          We believe in the power of collaboration to address common challenges
          faced by scientific organizations. Through collective efforts, we can
          overcome resource limitations and competitive pressures, especially
          for smaller groups. For instance, joining forces to develop
          open-source solutions can eliminate costly software licenses,
          benefiting all involved parties.
